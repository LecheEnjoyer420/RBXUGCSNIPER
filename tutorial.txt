Open Config for all this.

1. Insert Roblox Cookie where prompted in the Roblox Cookie session.
2. Webhook area asks for you to make a discord webhook. If you wanna learn how to make a webhook, search up a guide on youtube or google.
3. Make a discord bot and put the bot token where it asks for token. (Check youtube for more info on making a bot)
4. You can use proxies, but you don't need to. If you wanna use them however, make sure to paste them in the proxies.txt and set the config to true.
5. Paste limited ID's in between the " " in the limiteds section.
6. Save the config.

Thats pretty much it.
